# Ardruino_Halloweed

A pair of 'eyes' is following you. When you turn around, you see a tray with candies turning quietly inside a basket. Sweet! You want a piece of candy. Before your figures reach any candy, the music plays, the colorful lights at backet rim dance and the pumpkin head lightens up! 

The Halloween basket made of of Servo, Ultrasound Sensor, Stepper Motor, L293D IC, Motion sensor, Neopixel LEDs, Buzzer and LEDs.
